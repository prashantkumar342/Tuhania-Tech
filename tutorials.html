        <h2>Linux</h2>
        <h3>What is Linux ?</h3>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-nib"></i> Linux is an operating system just like iOS, Android, Windows.
          Linux is free and open source. In fact, one of the most popular Operating system on the planet, the Android,
          is powered
          by the Linux OS. Operating System is an type of Software that manages all the system resources associated with
          our
          system.</p><br>
        <p><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-nib"></i> The main parts or services with Linux developed and run :--</p><br>
        <p><strong>(1.) Bootloader -</strong> This is also an system software that manages all boot processes of you
          linux system. boot up your system.
          Bootloader starts your operating system and starts requried Daemons or services.</p>
        <p><strong>(2.) Kernel -</strong> This is the one piece of whole that is actually called 'Linux'. The kernel is
          the core of the Operating System and
          manages the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices. The kernel is the lowest leve of the Operating System</p>
        <p><strong>(3.) Init System -</strong> This is a sub-system that bootstraps the user space and is charged with
          controlling daemons. One of the most widely used
          init systems is systemd, which also happens to be one of the most controversial. It is the init system that
          manages the
          boot process, once the initial booting is handed over from the bootloader.</p>
        <p><strong>(4.) Daemons -</strong> These are background serives that run in Operating System Such as printing,
          sound, fax, search indexing or other device
          drivers and other internet related background services.</p>
        <p><strong>(5.) Graphical Server -</strong> This is the sub system that renders something on display monitor. It
          is commonly referred to as the X server or just X.</p>
        <p><strong>(6.) Desktop Environment -</strong> This is the main piece of graphical user intreaction with linux.
          using this user can operate the linux operating system
          because linux do not have its own user interface in most of the case linux distributions are made with a
          desktop manage
          that provide us a graphical user interface with the help of this we can able to use or operate the linux
          ditribution by
          Graphical User interface. some most popular desktop Environment is:
        <ul>
          <li>Gnome</li>
          <li>KDE Plasama</li>
          <li>Mint etc.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>(7.) Applications -</strong> Desktop environments do not offer the full array of software
          applications. Just like macOS, Windows, Linux offers
          thousands upon thousands high-quality softwares titles that can easily found and installed by packge manager
          or app
          store. Most modern Linux distributions includes App Store-like tools that centralize and simply application
          installation. For example, ubunt Linux has the Ubuntu Software Center (a rebran of GNOME Software) which
          allows you to
          quickly search among the thousand of apps and install them from one centralizes location.</p>

        <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-nib"></i> What is an Operating System ?</h3>
        <p>An <Strong>Operating System</Strong> is a piece of software that manages all the resources of a computer
          system both hardware and
          software and provides an environment in which users can perform tasks by executing the applications or
          processes in a
          convenient and efficient manner. OS hides the complexity of the hardware by working as resource manager.
        </p>
        <h3>Layered Structure Of operating System :</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Layer 1 -</strong> Computer Hardware</li>
          <li><strong>Layer 2 -</strong> CPU Scheduling</li>
          <li><strong>Layer 3 -</strong> Memory Management</li>

        </ul><br>
        <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-nib"></i> Objectives of OS</h3>
        <p><b>The main targets of an operating system are as follows :
          </b></p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Convenience -</b> An operating system improves the use of a Hardware. Operating systems gives the
            ability to users to use systems without
            the stress of configuring system and resource management.</li>br
          <li><b>Efficiency -</b> An Operating System has the ability to manage all the resources properly and use them
            as needed. This is due to less
            time spent on configuring the system.</li><br>
          <li><b>Ability to evolve -</b> An operating system should be designed in such a way that it allows for the
            effective development, testing, and
            introduction of new features without interfering with service.
          </li><br>
          <li><b>Management Of System Resources -</b> Operating systems are able to share resources fairly among various
            processes that are running and user.
          </li><br>
        </ul>
        <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-nib"></i> Functions Of Operating System</h3>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Memory management :</b> <br>
            <p>Operating System Manages the primary or main memory. If any program is executed, it has to be present in
              the memory.
              Main memory is faster than Secondary memory and directly accessed by the CPU. When a program is executed
              the operating
              system allocates the required memory to the process of it and by the CPU it handles the process in an
              efficient manner
              after the completion of the process Operating System deallocates the memory and free up the space in main
              memory for
              another process.</p><br>
            <b>Operating System :</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Allocates and Deallocates the memory</li>
              <li>Keeping the record of which part of memory is used and which process is using.</li>
              <li>Distributing the memory while multiprocessing etc.</li>
            </ul>
          </li><br>
          <li>
            <b>CPU Management or Scheduling :</b><br>
            <p>Every software that runs on a computer, whether in the background or in the frontend, is a process.
              Processor management
              is an execution unit in which a program operates. The operating system determines the status of the
              processor and
              processes, selects a job and its processor, allocates the processor to the process, and de-allocates the
              processor after
              the process is completed
              <br><br>When more than one process runs on the system the OS decides how and when a process will use the
              CPU.
              Hence, the name is
              also <b>CPU Scheduling. <br>The OS :</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Manages the CPU uses by process.</li>
              <li>Keeps the record of CPU status.
              </li>
            </ul><br>
            <b>Certain algorithms used for CPU Scheduling in OS are as follows :</b>
            <ul>
              <li>First Come First Out.
              </li>
              <li>Shortest Job First.</li>
              <li>Round-Robin Scheduling.</li>
              <li>Priority-based scheduling etc.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><b>File Management :</b><br>The operating system manages resource allocation and deallocation. It
            specifies
            which process receives the file and for
            how long. It also keeps track of information, location,uses,status, and so on. These groupings of resources
            are referred
            to as file systems. The files on a system are stored in different directories. <br><b>The OS:</b><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Keeps records of the status of and locations of files.
              </li>
              <li>Allocates and deallocates.</li>
              <li>Decides who gets the resources</li>
            </ul>
          </li><br>
          <li><b>Storage management :</b><br>
            Storage Management is defined as it refers to the management of the data storage equipment’s that are used
            to store the
            user/computer generated data. Hence it is a tool or set of processes used by an administrator to keep your
            data and
            storage equipment’s safe. Storage management is a process for users to optimize the use of storage devices
            and to
            protect the integrity of data for any media on which it resides and the category of storage
            management generally contain the different type of subcategories covering aspects such as security,
            virtualization and
            more, as well as different types of provisioning or automation, which is generally made up the entire
            storage management
            software market.
            <br><br>
            <b>The OS uses storage management for :</b><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Improving the performance of the data storage resources.</li>
              <li>It Optimizes the use of various storage devices.</li>
              <li>Assists businesses in storing more data on exiting hardware, speeding up the data retrieval process,
                preventing,
                preventing data loss, meeting data retention regulations, and lowering IT costs.</li>
